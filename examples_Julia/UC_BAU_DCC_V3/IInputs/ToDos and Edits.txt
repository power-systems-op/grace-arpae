Include initial values for the storage at Friday and Monday

Include regional reserve requirements

# The column title for NoLoad Heat Rate must be "NoLoadHR"

# In the generator's reserve limits, we have used spinning reserve limits 

# Update the format of renewable generation data

# In the orgninal data sheet, all ramp rate limits are in MW/Mins. They must be converted to MW/Hour. Minimum and maximum generation limits must be taken into account as well. 
Shutdown ramp rate to be the maximum of hourly ramp rate and minimum generation limit and not beyond maximum generation limit.
Startup ramp rate follows the same rule

# The heat rate curves data is wrong

# nuclear''s min and max in not identical

# the input files format for hydro, solar, and wind is not consistent

#Update storage
#Print names and scheduled reeserves 

Inconsistent column names: 
Spinning reserve limit, UpTimeInit, DownTimeInit, ShutdownCost, FastStart

ramp rate limits must be in MW/Hour

Total gen and total demand not equal. total gen is higher than total demand 

The generators and storage file headers for their names must be consitent with wthat is used in he code for printing the resulyts
