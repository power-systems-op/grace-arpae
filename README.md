# GRACE

A Grid thatâ€™s Risk-Aware for Clean Electricity (GRACE) is an energy management system (EMS) framework for characterizing the uncertainty of electric power system assets to optimize their performance. This EMS determines the scheduling, dispatch, and compensation of different resources in organized wholesale electricity markets and vertically integrated utilities by building upon industry-implemented market structure and algorithms to incorporate risk considerations.

GRACE is a Julia-based package for power systems optimization based on the CPLEX optimization software. GRACE is designed to be flexible for performing high-level analysis for industry and researchers.

## Installation
* GRACE is a Julia package and requires a Julia installation v1.5 or later.
* GRACE uses CPLEX solver. We recommend create enroll to the [IBM Academic Initiative](https://www.ibm.com/academic/home) and download [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer).

## Requirements
* Julia version 1.5.0 or later
* CPLEX Optimization Studio V12.10 or later
