# Welcome to the GRACE Software Repository 

A Grid thatâ€™s Risk-Aware for Clean Electricity (GRACE) is an energy management system (EMS) framework for characterizing the uncertainty of electric power system assets to optimize their performance. This EMS determines the scheduling, dispatch, and compensation of different resources in organized wholesale electricity markets and vertically integrated utilities by building upon industry-implemented market structure and algorithms to incorporate risk considerations.
